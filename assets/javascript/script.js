// create variables for questions 
    // each var has an array of answers a, b, c, d ??? 

// add time constraint for quizQuestions function using setTimeout. lets say 3 min

// create a function for getting the answers. quizQuestion
// every time a question is asked, it needs to be appended to the main html element

    // create object literals for each question ???
        // question: ""
            // answers: {
                // a: "",
                // b: "",
                //......
            // }
            // correct answer: ""

    // use if statements questions... if the answer is correct, then score++. if wrong, then deduct time from quiz

// take the answers and add them to localstorage using setItem 

// use an event listener (on click) to take highscore out of localstorage using getItem and show highscore


// GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
// WHEN I click the start button
// THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// WHEN I answer a question
// THEN I am presented with another question
// WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
// THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
// THEN the game is over
// WHEN the game is over
// THEN I can save my initials and score
